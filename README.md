## Introduction

Jib provides a Docker powered local development experience for Laravel that is compatible with Windows using PowerShell. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Jib. Jibs's simple CLI means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.

**NOTE:** When passing 'dash' paramters, e.g. -d, you need to scape the dash with a backtick: `-d.

#### Inspiration

Jib is a drop-in repplacement for [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail).

## Official Documentation

Jib supports all the Sail CLI commands, so you can refer to the offical Documentation found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/sail).

## Tutorial

I have writen a tutorial on [developing Laravel in Windows](https://kinori.tech/blog/en/2023/10/23/laravel-sail-in-windows-with-docker-and-powershell/?mtm_campaign=github) with Docker and PowerShell that shows how Invoke-Jib can be used.

## License

Jib is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
